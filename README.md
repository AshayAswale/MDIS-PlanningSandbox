Multi-Drone Indoor Slam Planning Sandbox

## Instructions to run:
### Animation on Dan's given matlab floor plan
>Work in progress

Simply moves an agent dot on the map while 'scanning'

```bash
python3 main.py
```

### Animation on an empty map of 100x100
Stupid simulation of 3 dots moving in diagonal directions

Extremely stupid, won't recommend working on this
```bash
python3 trial.py
```

### Animation on Dan's new building plan with doors and rooms defined
> Not done yet

### A* Path Planner
